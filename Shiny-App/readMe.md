This Shiny App displays data, analysis, and visualizations of US News rankings for US universities, allowing for interactive user input.  
In addition to the three tabs of the app, some user inputs can be controlled by voice commands. 

Some voice commands to note:
- "US News": opens the US News website
- "Private": filters only private schools in the Data Explorer tab
- "Public": filters only public schools in the Data Explorer tab

In addition, the X & Y axes in the Statistical Analysis tab can be changed with voice commands to any of the given options:
- "Y endowment"
- "Y acceptance rate"
- "Y median start salary"
- "Y score"
- "Y tuition"
- "X endowment"
- "X acceptance rate"
- "X median start salary"
- "X score"
- "X tuition"

Our data is scraped from US News University rankings (https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities).
